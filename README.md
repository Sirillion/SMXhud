**Description:**

With the release of A20 SMXhud has now evolved into the world of Harmony. This means that it does now mod deeper than ever before and that opens the door for more and better features. On the flip side this means it is no longer EAC friendly, so turn EAC off.

The purpose of SMXhud is to take the in-game HUD into a more horror like and gritty art style all while trying to stay as informative as possible while not being intrusive on your gameplay.

> Dependencies: SMXlib, ZMXhudCP.

> Credits: Sirillion, sphereii, TormentedEMu

> Compatibility: Will probably work with most mods/modlets that doesn't modify the same windows/areas in the XUI files and have a lower load order.
