</p>

**Description:**

SMXhud is SMX as you know it from Alpha 16 first remade into a modlet and tweaked for Alpha 17 & 18 and now further enhanced for Alpha 19. The purpose of SMXhud is to take the in-game HUD into a more horror like and gritty art style all while trying to stay as informative as possible while not being intrusive on your gameplay.

> Dependencies: SMXlib, ZMXhudCP.

> Compatibility: Will probably work with most mods/modlets that doesn't modify the same windows/areas in the XUI files and have a lower load order.
